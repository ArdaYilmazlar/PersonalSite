            <h3>Java</h3>
            <p>Being the first object oriented programming language i have learned, most of my coding was made on java. I used it
                on various projects and programming challanges such as 
                <a href="https://github.com/ArdaYilmazlar/LocalSocialNetwork">Local Social Network</a> and
                <a href="http://https://github.com/ArdaYilmazlar/TicTacToe">TicTacToe</a> (Where i experimented with GUI making in java).

                <h3>C</h3>
                <p>C was the first programming language i picked up. I honed my understanding on how a programmming language works, logic behind pointers,
                    creating algorithms in C. I have made a 
                    <a href="https://github.com/ArdaYilmazlar/C-Sudoku">Sudoku creator/player</a>
                    in it, where the user can control a cursor on a console screen with keyboard.
